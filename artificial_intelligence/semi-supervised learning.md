### Semi-supervised learning

Semi-supervised learning is used when there are few labeled dataset, but most of the other are un-labeled, so how to use these un-labeled data?

self-learning:
1. Use labeled data to train a model;
2. Use trained model to predict un-labeled datasets;
3. Select most confident prediction and add them back into original dataset;
4. Loop to train the model;

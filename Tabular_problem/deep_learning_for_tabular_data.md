### Deep Learning for Tabular data


#### Attention based

  I have tested it if for only less data won't get better result than machine learning. Paper mentions: `significantly improv- ing performance when unlabeled data is abundant`, so it will be more better if we have more unlabeled data. For traditional dataset, try machine learning!

LiteLLM is a tool designed to simplify the process of interacting with multiple large language models (LLMs) by providing a unified interface. Here's a breakdown of what LiteLLM is and its core functionalities based on the provided documentation:

1. **Unified Interface**:
   - LiteLLM allows users to call numerous LLMs using the same input/output format, which streamlines the process of working with different providers.

2. **Provider Agnostic**:
   - It translates inputs to the provider's specific endpoints for `completion`, `embedding`, and `image_generation`, abstracting away the differences between providers.

3. **Consistent Output**:
   - Regardless of the underlying LLM provider, text responses are consistently available at a specific location in the response object, making it easier to process the output.

4. **Retry/Fallback Logic**:
   - LiteLLM includes logic to retry requests or fallback to alternative deployments if one fails, which can be particularly useful when dealing with multiple deployments across providers like Azure or OpenAI.

5. **Cost Tracking**:
   - It offers the ability to track spending and set budgets per project, which is crucial for managing costs in commercial applications.

6. **OpenAI Proxy Server**:
   - LiteLLM includes an OpenAI proxy server that enables load balancing and cost tracking across different projects and users.

7. **Python SDK**:
   - There's a Python SDK that allows users to call various LLMs, perform load balancing, and track costs directly within a Python environment.

8. **Basic Usage**:
   - The Python SDK is straightforward to use, requiring only a few lines of code to get started.

9. **Streaming**:
   - LiteLLM supports streaming responses, which can be useful for applications that require real-time feedback.

10. **Exception Handling**:
    - It maps exceptions from all supported providers to OpenAI's exception types, making it easier to implement error handling.

11. **Logging and Observability**:
    - LiteLLM provides predefined callbacks for logging LLM input/output to various observability and logging tools.

12. **Cost and Usage Tracking**:
    - Users can implement custom callback functions to track costs, usage, and latency, especially useful for streaming requests.

13. **Proxy Endpoints**:
    - The documentation mentions Swagger Docs for proxy endpoints, which likely provides detailed API documentation for the proxy server.

14. **Quick Start with Proxy**:
    - There's a CLI tool to quickly start the LiteLLM proxy and make requests to it.

15. **More Details**:
    - The documentation hints at advanced features like exception mapping, retries, model fallbacks, and spend management through proxy virtual keys.

In summary, LiteLLM is a versatile tool that aims to make it easier for developers to work with multiple large language models by providing a consistent interface, cost management, and advanced features like streaming and observability. Its core is the ability to abstract away the complexities of interacting with different LLM providers, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than dealing with the intricacies of each provider's API.

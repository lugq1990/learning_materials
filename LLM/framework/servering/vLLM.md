![official web for vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html)

vLLM is a library designed to facilitate efficient inference and serving of large language models (LLMs). Here's a summary of what vLLM is, its core features, and how it works:

1. **Purpose**:
   - vLLM aims to provide an easy, fast, and cost-effective solution for serving LLMs.

2. **Performance**:
   - It is designed to achieve state-of-the-art serving throughput with features like:
     - Efficient management of attention key and value memory through **PagedAttention**.
     - Continuous batching of incoming requests for better throughput.
     - Fast model execution using CUDA/HIP graph for GPU acceleration.
     - Quantization techniques such as GPTQ, AWQ, SqueezeLLM, and FP8 KV Cache to improve speed and reduce memory usage.
     - Optimized CUDA kernels for enhanced performance on NVIDIA GPUs.

3. **Flexibility and Usability**:
   - vLLM offers seamless integration with popular HuggingFace models.
   - Supports high-throughput serving with various decoding algorithms, including parallel sampling and beam search.
   - Provides tensor parallelism support for distributed inference across multiple GPUs.
   - Offers streaming outputs for efficient data handling.
   - Includes an OpenAI-compatible API server for easy integration with existing systems.
   - Supports both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.

4. **Experimental Features**:
   - Prefix caching support for improved efficiency in certain use cases.
   - Multi-lora support, which may refer to multi-modal learning or other advanced features.

5. **Documentation and Resources**:
   - vLLM comes with comprehensive documentation covering topics such as:
     - Serving with an OpenAI-compatible server.
     - Deploying with Docker for ease of use in containerized environments.
     - Distributed inference and serving for scaling up.
     - Production metrics for monitoring performance.
     - Environment variables and usage stats collection for configuration and analytics.
     - Integrations with other systems and tools.
   - It also provides developer documentation on the vLLM engine, including details on the LLMEngine, AsyncLLMEngine, and vLLM Paged Attention.

6. **Core Technology - PagedAttention**:
   - A key component of vLLM is the PagedAttention mechanism, which is likely an optimization technique for managing memory usage in attention-based models, allowing for more efficient handling of large models.

7. **Community and Further Reading**:
   - vLLM has an active community and provides resources such as blog posts, research papers, and meetups for users to learn more about the technology.

In summary, vLLM is a high-performance library for serving LLMs that focuses on speed, efficiency, and ease of use. Its core lies in its innovative serving capabilities and optimizations that make it a compelling choice for developers and companies looking to deploy LLMs in production environments.
